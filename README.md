It contains a set of javaScript projects ,Although it seems simple,but you may learn a lot from it,So I advise everyone to practice it

you will learn : 
 1- making responsive web design
 2- How to deal with events using js
 3- Improve your creativity and imagination
 4- problem solving (simple issues)
 5- Positioning elements using CSS (especially with flexbox)
 ... and you can add new features for each project to improve yourself and get finally an amazing result !! i hope that
